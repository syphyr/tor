  o Minor bugfixes (stream flow control performance):
    - Use a 5 ms grace period to allow an edge connection to flush its stream
      data to the socket before sending an XOFF. This significantly reduces the
      number of XON/XOFF messages sent when (1) the application is reading
      stream data at a fast rate, and (2) when conflux is enabled.
      Fixes part of bug 41130; bugfix on 0.4.7.2-alpha
