  o Minor features (HTTPTunnelPort):
    - Implement new HTTPTunnelPort features for interoperability with
      Arti's HTTP CONNECT proxy.  This work adds new headers to
      requests to and replies from the HttpConnectPort,
      support for OPTIONS requests, tightens the expected syntax
      for Proxy-Authorization, and increases defense-in-depth
      against some kinds of cross-site HTTP attacks.
      Closes ticket 41156.  Implements proposal 365.
