  o Major bugfixes (onion service directory cache):
    - Preserve the download counter of an onion service descriptor across
      descriptor uploads, so that recently updated descriptors don't get
      pruned if there is memory pressure soon after update. Additionally,
      create a separate torrc option MaxHSDirCacheBytes that defaults to the
      former 20% of MaxMemInQueues threshold, but can be controlled by
      relay operators under DoS. Also enforce this theshold during HSDir
      uploads. Fixes bug 41006; bugfix on 0.4.8.14.
