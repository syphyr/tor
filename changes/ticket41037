  o Minor bugfix (conflux):
    - Avoid a non fatal assert when describing a conflux circuit on the control
      port after being prepped to be freed. Fixes bug 41037; bugfix on 0.4.8.15.
    - Remove the pending nonce if we realize that the nonce of the unlinked
      circuit is not tracked anymore. Should avoid the non fatal assert
      triggered with a control port circuit event.
