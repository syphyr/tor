  o Minor features (security, reliability):
    - When KeepaliveIsolateSOCKSAuth is keeping a circuit alive,
      expire the circuit based on when it was last in use for any stream,
      not (as we did before) based on when a stream was last attached to it.
      Closes ticket 41157. Implements a minimal version of
      Proposal 368.
