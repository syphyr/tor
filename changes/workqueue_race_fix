  o Major bugfixes (threading):
    - Fix race condition where main thread could proceed with cleanup
      before worker threads finished exiting, causing crashes when
      workers tried to acquire already-freed mutexes. Replace mutex
      ownership transfer pattern with explicit worker counting and
      condition variable signaling. Pre-initialize OpenSSL crypto
      subsystems before creating worker threads to prevent initialization
      races (OpenSSL 3.x). Add atomic operations for thread-safe log
      level checking. Fixes bug 41127 and 41148; bugfix on 0.4.8.13-dev.
